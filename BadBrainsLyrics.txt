You don't want me anymore
So I'll walk right out the door
Played a game right from the start
I trust you, you used me
And now my heart's all torn apart
So I'm sailin', well I'm sailin' on
Well I'm moving, hey I'm moving on
Sail on, Sail on, Sail on
Try to see if I'll give up
But there wasn't any luck
It's a fact, a fact of life
That's the games, the games of strife
Everything is all in stride
So I'm sailin', well I'm sailin' on
Well I'm moving, hey I'm moving on
Sail on, Sail on, Sail on
There's too many years with too many tears
And too many days

Don't need no Ivory Liquid
Don't want no Afro Sheen
Don't need the latest fashions
Don't want my hair to smell clean
I've got my automotion
I've got that superpotion
And if you think I'm going crazy
Then pretty baby it might be you babe
Don't need no first clss
Do need no second class
All of the best of all that can kiss my ass
I've got my claim to fame
I've got that positive flame and if you think I'm going crazy
They pretty babe it might be you babe

Don't care what they may say we got that attitude
Don't care what they may do we got that attitude
Hey we got the P.M.A.
Hey we got the P.M.A.
Hey we got the P.M.A.

You tell me what to say and when to say it.
You tell me what to do and how to do it.
And if I ask you why, yoou'll arrest me.
And if I call you lie, you'll detest me.
You control what I'll be, you control who I see.
And if I let you you'll control me.
You're the man who owns all the keys to the stores.
You're the man who always wants so much more.
You're the regulator.

Banned in D.C. with a thousand other places to go. 
Gonna swim across the Atlantic cause that's the only place I can go. 
You, you can't hurt me, why I'm banned in D.C. 
We, we got ourselves. 
Gonna sing it. Gonna love it. Gonna work it out to any length. 
Don't worry, no worry about what the people say. 
We got ourselves. We gonna make it anyway. 
You, you can't hurt me, 
why I'm banned in D.C. 
And if you ban us from your clubs, 
it's the right time, 
with the right mind. 
And if you think we really care, 
you won't find in my mind. 
Oh, Oh, you can't afford to close your doors so soon no more.

Some people look at me and talk about me like a clown 
They just don't realize it's just my simple way to get down
I've got that supertouch 
Chances are I've got too much 
I've come to let you see 
That you also can be free
It seems like everytime we all try to go underground 
The stinkin' troopers them, they think that we are fooling around
We have had about enough 
Now we're gonna get real tough 
It happens everyday, 
That's why we got P.M.A....

People just pretending that's a let down 
Undercover lover- that's my heart now 
Struggle just in living, that's the realm of 
Accept me as I'm not, and that's a shitfit
My best ain't good enough for you 
My test is what you gonna do 
Ain't no any kind of way 
Love was lost in yesterday
Now we've felt this, so you'll get yours now 
Everybody's living and nobody's giving 
And nobody gives a damn 
You must understand me, the end is surely coming 
Prepare for the final plan
People just pretending, that's a let down 
Undercover lover, that's my heart now 
Struggle just in living, that's the realm of 
accept me as i'm not, and that's a shitfit

Say I'm leaving this Babylon
It will not be too long
It will not be too long now
I said my people are starvin but your money's runnin
Your dollar, dollar drop down real low
You ain't got no gold to show
We gonna step right through that door
Not gonna come back no more

The bourgeoisie had better watch out for me
Al throughout this so called nation
we don't want your filthy money
we don't need your innocent bloodshed
We just wanna end your world
Well my mind's made up
Yes it's time for you to pay
better watch out for me
I'm a member of the F.V.K.

Not as much but with such intensity
I'd like to be what you don't want me to be
I like to cram their chivalry in there guts
I'd like to leave it all behind with the rest of the nuts
I, I
Not as much but with more feeling now
I'd like to forget about you and try to break it somehow
I'd like to push it aside till I can't see no more
I'd like to leave you where I found you lying on the floor
I, I
I guess it's too bad
I guess it's too bad
I guess it's too bad, I guess it's too bad for you
I guess it's too bad
I guess it's too bad
I guess it's too bad, I guess it's too bad for you It seems the truth always prevails on your face
And in the end I see what's in it's place
So in the future you just may see that what you receive is what you gave to me.

No one dared to show for that shower,
when nobody turned to be clean,
was not even touched by the water,
just another Nazi scheme.
The Big Takeover.
All throughout this so called nation,
prepare yourself for the final quest.
Your world is doomed with your own integration,
just another Nazi test.
The Big Takeover.
My, my, The Big Takeover.
So understand me when I say there's no hope for the USA.
Your world is doomed with our own integration.
Just another Nazi test.

I make my decisions with precision
Lost inside this manned collision
Just to see what is to be perfectly my fantasy
I come to know with now dismay
that is this world we all must pay
pay to write, pay to play, pay to cum, pay to fight! 
And all this time, with just our minds
We soon will find whatÂ¹s left behind
Not long ago when things were slow
we all got by with what we know
the end is near
hearts filled with fear
don't want to listen to what they hear
And so it's now we choose to fight
to stick up for our bloody right
the right to sing
the right to dance
the right is ours we'll take the chance!
A PEACE TOGETHER
a piece apart
a piece of wisdom from our hearts.

You can't disappear anymore
I see your face lurking outside the window
You say you're a trifle, I'm a bore
You touch yourself put your fae in the pillow
But the funny thing about you is
You remembered to leave it behind
And the funny thing about me is
I'm a member of the Right Brigade
Makes no difference to me what side you choose
What side will lose
All there is to percieve is what I want
And I know how to get it
But the funny thing about you is
You remember to leave it behind
And the funny thing about me is
I'm a member of the Right Brigade

Walking down Babylon way.
Trying to live my life in peace.
Two young men call me not their brother,
tried to make me feel ashamed.
But I love I Jah,
he tell me not to be that way.
I luv I Jah yah,
got to keep my PMA.
My lovely sister judge me by my cloths yah.
Only to learn to her mistake,
not everyone's alike.
We're not all uptight,
no fuss, no fight.
Cool that way.
I luv I Jah,
he tell me not to be that way.
I luv I Jah yah,
got to keep my PMA.
