What do you mean it's time, time for me to
grow up? I don't want any part. It's right
to follow my heart. The new kids ran, ran
out the back door fast, and the bands
that came before they had their noses in
the air. Pretending that they care about
our scene just because our money's
green. I'll tell you stage dives make me
feel more alive than coded messages in
slowed down songs.
Now you're so ashamed, now I'm so
ashamed of you. We believed the same
things. You stand to the side. Rebirth of
hardcore pride. It all came true, too bad
you can't see all the good things that I
see.
Back in, back in the days when I'd wait to
see the old bands play. It didn't seem
like wasted days. I was so sincere, but
now I see more clearly. Music's only
work to them. It's not to me. So I say,
hats off to bands that change. Good
luck, go your own way. Why play for us,
if your heart's not in it? Cause what might
seem dumb to you is pounding in my
heart.
Now you're so ashamed, now you're so
ashamed of you. We believed the same
things. You stand to the side. Rebirth of
hardcore pride. It all came true. Too bad
you can't see. No, you just can't fucking
see it.
Now you just turn your back. You said I
don't want it anymore. Old friends you
attack. Our pain out of touch. You don't
get it do you? New stage, new ideas.
You don't have to make excuses for us.
Sitting there looking back, I'm scared.
Don't spoil memories of the way things
were.

Sitting down on a couch, you watch, a
fucking slave to a TV show. You thought
before but you sat and dropped. What
did you learn? You don't even know, and
I kid myself but my eyes are glued on this
thing.
It steals my time and wastes what I've
learned. I'm holding out for a better deal,
for something real. You know I'd like to
say that I could spend a day at home with
it left off. How strong's our will?
I can't blend with the ads I see. They're
better looking than me. You try to look
your best, but you'll never rest. Think, it
won't make you happy.
A standard set that I just cannot live up
to. It steals my time and wastes what
I've learned. I'm holding out for a better
deal, for something real. You know I'd
like to say that I could spend a day at
home with it left off. How strong's our
will?
Our lives are led by TV shows, you know
it's true. Instead of thinking we play
Donkey Kong. There's something wrong
with that. We're made to think life's like a
game show. So there we go again. The
one to die with the most toys is the one
who wins.
I just can't stand it.
Sitting down on a couch, you watch, a
fucking slave to a TV show. You thought
before but you sat and dropped. What
did you learn? You don't even know. It's
a brain vacation. A mental masturbation.
It steals my time and wastes what I've
learned. I'm holding out for some reality.
I'd like to say that I could spend a day at
home with it left off. How strong's our
will?

Tell me who's pure.
Tell me who's right.
Tell me the last time you fought a fair
fight. A loser's way to find some friends,
you look like a skin but that's where it
ends. True, they're always at our shows,
it doesn't mean we fit in with their hatred
and racism shit. They ruin our name, you
know what I mean. Racial supremicists
degrade our scene.
You know you can kiss my ass before I
read your zine. There's no good side to
this white power scene. Kids beat down
for standing up. Your turn will come
because we've all had enough. You look
like kids we know. You're not welcome
here. You don't like music and we don't
like fear. I guess it's your right to be
proud that you're white. Are you here for
music or just to pick fights.
Don't fool yourself cause you don't fool
me. It's not just blacks you hate, it's
everyone you see. Rich, poor, young
and old, whoever's in your way. What a
boring life, hating every day.
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING BUT HATRED!

Things I try don't work out. Other people
gripe and shout. That's not positive. I'm
not perfect. I'm just Civ.
Trial and error...Good Intentions!
Throw a beer at the stage, that's how you
behave. Paid admission, had no fun.
You think I'm the stupid one.
Think again...Good Intentions!
I'll just try my best...and you?
Nothing.

Dedicated to your cause look at all the
friends you lost. Discarded because I'm
no more use. Our tight friendship is
hanging loose. Stepping on the people
who were getting all the things you
wanted. Now you got them, we're
forgotten. No need.
For token interest in my life. Don't make
amends, don't even try. Guilty
Conscience? Maybe not. You just want
more of what I got. Stepping on the
people who were getting all the things you
wanted. Now you got them, we're
forgotten.
Try and think why you carry on this way.
It's not you talking, it's your greed I hear.
Nothing means nothing if you're
insincere.
I don't know why you decide I'm not worth
calling up. Things have changed between
you and me. We don't hang out but that's
ok.

Yesterday you were on my back just to
get my time. I guess it's not as precious
as it seems. Because I found the time for
hangin out and talkin on the phone. What
should I expect, now that my time is free
and you're nowhere to be found.
Next time I'll try, for the first time in my
life. It won't pass me by. Procrastinate it
can wait, I put it off.
LET'S START TODAY
My room's a mess and I can't get
dressed. I gotta be out by eight o'clock.
Deep inside I know the answer. Well
there's no time like the present and I'd
like to hang out but who doesn't. I've
made enough mistakes for this lifetime.
Now I'm here to make amends.
Next time I'll try, for the first time in my
life. It won't pass me by. Procrastinate it
can wait, I put it off.
START!
STOP!

Some people think they're always right
and right is all they'll ever be. Well
there's two sides and egos divide. And
we're so concerned with who's right.
These people are so quick to judge. Let's
get the judgement straight. It's not who's
wrong it's how we get along. And I'm not
too sure that we do yet.
TRUTH is a word that you're of. It's all
you said but I'd love to see you give
someone else a chance.
Open up, it's not so hard. Is hard what
you want to be to kick some ass. It's a
sure bet you'll get your way, but with no
friends left.
Don't say you know what I'm about,
because you don't. For God's sake give
me a fucking break. You don't even know
my name.
TRUTH is a word that you're of. It's all
you said but I'd love to see you give
someone else a chance.
I listen to the things you say, I've
weighed the facts out in my head. Can
you do the same...No, then don't waste
my time.
TRUTH is a word that you're of. It's all
you said but I'd love to see you give
someone else a chance.
This time my mind is set. My side you'll
never get.
What I say. What did you say. We can
both be right just not in the same way.
You think we could reach some common
ground...No...no way.

I've worked so hard on things that never
seemed to pay off. But looking back I
realize they never really meant that
much. And if I let you down, it might not
be the last time. I'm sorry, and I know
how it feels when my eyes see a loser in
the mirror. I think "What did I do?" Sure I
fucked up, but I got back up, so that
loser shit's out the window.
And if I let you down, it might not be the
last time. Cheer up, it will hurt much less
tomorrow. We're all tired of fucking up
and that's not just being sorry. It means
brush the dirt off, get up and try again.
When you're sick of trying, how can you
expext to succeed? I can't recall my first
failure, and I'll forget this one too over
time.
And if you've been let down and if it's not
the first time, cheer up, it will hurt much
less tomorrow. We're all tired of fucking
up and that's not just being sorry. It
means brush the dirt off, get up and try
again.

It seems that all successful things and all
the envy that they bring might not be
worth it. Being shot down every minute
for the effort you put in and all the time
that you've spent. The key to success is
the faith in knowing you're right.
Memories of better days is what you're
holding on to, when the critics loved you.
Competition has it's way of bringing you
down.
Always being number one, robs the music
of its fun. Ego trips get in the way of the
goals we've set. Now the audience is
split. We've worked too hard to watch it
ALL FADE AWAY.
Memories of better days is what you're
holding on to, when the critics loved you.
Competition has it's way of making you
mad. Why can't you be glad...for me.
Well I know what competition means and
the feelings that it brings. Friends that
want to be on top, you're on the list of
friends to drop. Success is what I want
to feel, at your expense it isn't real, it's
jealousy...and jealousy's not true. No it's
not true...at your expense. In
competition with you.

I'm lucky to be where I am today.
Not by myself, summers on the way.
The jobs I'll be working, the money I'll spend, not making a living,
just making new friends.
And I'm trying my hardest to make the most out of every minute.
Not getting any younger, getting older. it's scary.
Swept out from under your feet your youth's gone and you wonder why...
BECAUSE TIME FLIES
How much does it cost the booze and the drugs you need.
Put your life on pause.
Is it that much fun, maybe for some.
I think its dumb to let anyone or anything slow me down or prevent me from living my life.
Not getting younger, getting older.
It's scary.
Swept out from under your feet your youth's gone and you wonder why.
Work machine makes us old before our time.
I don't consent that's how I feel.
Because life's too short , so I do what I can to get by.
I'll decide where my time is spent and you can bet there'll be a smile on my face.
How about yours? How about yours!?

Man's best friend is beautiful and
affectionate and ideal pet. Cats are the
same, we make up their names and our
love for them is real. Listen up, I gotta
ask it, how can we be so cruel? You say
you care, that's a lie. My true
compassion is for all living things and not
just the ones who are cute so I do what I
can. I wanna save lives and I've got a
plan.
Under the table he'll eat your dinner like
the veggies we can't stand. What kind of
meal would he make? We don't want to
ask it. Tradition is all that keeps him
alive. Listen up, I gotta ask it, how can
we be so cruel? You say you care, that's
a lie. My true compassion is for all living
things and not just the ones who are cute
so I do what I can. I wanna save lives
and I've got a plan.
Why am I so upset. Don't even own a
pet. I am not trying to press my will. I am
not the first to say...
THOU SHALT NOT KILL
Full is all you want to feel. We eat to stay
alive, but it's their lives we steal. I think
we'd like to change, but most of us are
stuck, that's why cats and dogs have
ALL THE LUCK.
